# OMNISIGHT - Precognitive Security System

**Tagline**: "See Everything. Understand Everything. Prevent Everything."

OMNISIGHT is a revolutionary edge AI application for Axis cameras that transforms passive security cameras into active guardians through precognitive intelligence, swarm collaboration, and natural language understanding.

## Core Innovations

### Timeline Threading™
Industry's first precognitive security system showing 3-5 probable futures with confidence scores, enabling intervention before incidents occur.

### Swarm Intelligence
Network effect where cameras share threat signatures and learn collectively without sharing raw video data (privacy-preserving federated learning).

### Natural Language Interface
Conversational AI for intuitive camera control and investigation - no complex UIs, just talk to your security system.

### Autonomous Operations
Self-configuring, self-learning edge AI that becomes operational in <30 seconds from unboxing.

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oneshot2001/OmniSight-dev.git
cd OmniSight-dev
```

2. Set up ACAP SDK Docker environment:
```bash
docker pull axisecp/acap-native-sdk:latest
```
