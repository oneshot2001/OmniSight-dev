# ACAP version 12

![ACAP](https://developer.axis.com/assets/images/index-1bf0e8301162708dfe1e5c018d0f2d88.jpg)

Welcome to the AXIS Camera Application Platform (ACAP) documentation. The
ACAP SDK is an open development framework designed to empower developers to
create custom applications that run directly on Axis network devices, such
as our cameras and intercoms. By leveraging the processing capabilities of
these devices, ACAP applications enable edge-based computing with on-device,
local processing of data, reducing latency, and minimizing bandwidth usage.

To start out with ACAP development, see the [Get started](https://developer.axis.com/acap/get-started/set-up-developer-environment/pre-requisites/) section.

Guides for specific topics can be found in [Develop ACAP applications](https://developer.axis.com/acap/develop/).

For detailed information about the APIs, see the [Native SDK API](https://developer.axis.com/acap/api/) section.

## Use cases [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/\#use-cases "Direct link to Use cases")

ACAP makes it possible to develop applications for a wide range of use cases:

- Security and safety applications that improve surveillance systems and facilitate investigation.
- Business intelligence applications that improve business efficiency.
- Product feature plug-ins that add value beyond the Axis product's core functionality.
- Address customer specific use cases that can't be solved with off-the-shelf products.

## Key features [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/\#key-features "Direct link to Key features")

- Access to most common product features, including video, the event and parameter systems, I/O ports, and more.
- Enables hardware acceleration on specific functions such as image analysis computations and overlay graphics.
- Toolchain with support for multiple architectures to build applications for all ACAP-enabled Axis products.
- Documentation, tutorials and example applications for all APIs to kick-start your development.

## Containerized SDK [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/\#containerized-sdk "Direct link to Containerized SDK")

ACAP development relies on the Docker toolchain, something we see many developers
use to manage their software. An important advantage of distributing a
containerized SDK is that the ACAP development environment can be decoupled from
the underlying host operating system. This enables us to support development
across all Docker capable platforms, including not only Linux, but also Windows
and macOS. Docker also offers a rich set of tools to build and ship software.

## ACAP versioning [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/\#acap-versioning "Direct link to ACAP versioning")

When developing ACAP applications, it is important to use a supported ACAP
version. What ACAP version is supported depends on which AXIS OS LTS is
targeted. From AXIS OS 12.0 (but not before) the ACAP version aligns with
the AXIS OS version. See the figure below to find what ACAP version is
right for you. Note that the ACAP versions are clickable and take you to the
corresponding ACAP documentation version. See
[Version history](https://developer.axis.com/acap/version-history/) for more information.
