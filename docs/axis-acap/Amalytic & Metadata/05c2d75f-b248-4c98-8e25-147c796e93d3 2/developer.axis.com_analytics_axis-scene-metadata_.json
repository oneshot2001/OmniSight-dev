This documentation describes how to consume, interface with, and make use of this data when building applications. The provided data can be used in various applications for real-time situational awareness, efficient data searches, and identifying trends and patterns.\n\nAxis devices such as cameras and radars track and collect information about detected objects, including humans, vehicles, and unclassified movement. Data is available under multiple topics to address different use cases. The table below provides an overview of the topics and their properties:\n\n| Topic | Summary | Availability | Source |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Analytics Scene Description | Real-time tracking of objects | [RTSP](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/protocols/rtsp/), [ACAP SDK](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/protocols/message-broker/), [MQTT](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/protocols/mqtt/) ​ | [Fusion Tracker](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/) |\n| Consolidated Track | Information about each object is summarized and delivered once the object leaves the scene. | [ACAP SDK](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/protocols/message-broker/), [MQTT](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/protocols/mqtt/) | [Track Consolidation](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/track-consolidation/) |\n\nAll topics are encoded in JSON following [Analytics Data Format](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/data-formats/analytics-data-format/). Most data is also translated into [ONVIF conformant](https://www.onvif.org/profiles/specifications/) XML over RTSP.\n\nAXIS Scene Metadata is supported across various devices, including products with multiple sensor types. For instance, multi-sensor devices like the [AXIS Q1686-DLE](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-q1686-dle) radar-video device combine sensor outputs to deliver a coherent and comprehensive scene understanding.\n\nFor a complete list of supported products, visit the [compatible products](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-scene-metadata#compatible-products) page. Click **View More** to see the full list.\n\nTo get started, see the [Getting Started guide](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/getting-started/).\n\nTo read more about central concepts to AXIS Scene Metadata, such as [object tracking](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/concepts/object-tracking/), [processing modules](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/concepts/processing-modules/), [data framing](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/concepts/data-framing/), etc., see the [concepts section](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/concepts/).\n\ninfo\n\nThis documentation describe the AXIS Scene Metadata functionality as of the latest version of the [active track](https://help.axis.com/axis-os#active-track) for AXIS OS.\n\n![metadata-homepage-stock-image](https://developer.axis.com/assets/images/index.metadata-homepage-stock-image-560065cef9d92f3d8c9ec18fb075049f.webp)\n\nLast updated on **Sep 4, 2025**\n\n[Previous\\\\\n\\\\\nAXIS Object Analytics counting data](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-object-analytics/how-to-guides/axis-object-analytics-counting-data/) [Next\\\\\n\\\\\nGetting started](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/getting-started/)\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\n- [Axis Developer Community](https://axis.com/developer-community)\n- [Axis on GitHub](https://github.com/AxisCommunications)\n\nSOCIAL\n\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/axis-communications)\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AxisCommunications)\n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE\n\n- [Legal](https://www.axis.com/legal)\n- [Privacy](https://www.axis.com/privacy)\n\n© 2025 Axis Communications AB.
