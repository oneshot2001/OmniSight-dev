# Simplifying your application development with the enhanced ACAP SDK

September 6, 2024

At Axis, our goal is to continually enhance the tools and technologies that empower you to create cutting-edge solutions.

In 2021, we introduced the capability to run containers on our devices, accompanied by the launch of the Computer Vision SDK. This allowed for streamlined development of computer vision applications and provided flexibility in building both native and containerized applications.

As we listen to your feedback and strive to make development simpler and more efficient, we recognize that the dual-SDK approach, while powerful, introduced unnecessary complexity. Developers were often faced with the challenge of navigating two distinct SDKs, which could complicate decision-making and slow down innovation.

To make your development process smoother and to ensure the highest standards of cybersecurity across the entire device lifecycle, we are unifying our approach. Going forward, the [ACAP SDK](https://developer.axis.com/acap/introduction/acap-sdk-overview/) will be your single, comprehensive tool for application development on Axis devices.

By focusing on the [ACAP SDK](https://developer.axis.com/acap/introduction/acap-sdk-overview/), we’re streamlining your workflow, ensuring that your applications benefit from consistent and secure firmware updates and are supported across an extensive range of Axis devices.

With the ACAP SDK, you can:

- Leverage the power of the DLPU (Deep Learning Processing Unit) to run sophisticated models.
- Execute [VAPIX](https://www.axis.com/for-developers/vapix-library "VAPIX® library") commands for robust control and customization.
- Enhance video feeds by overlaying graphics and text seamlessly.
- Harness device metadata from built-in analytics to create smarter applications.

All products with existing container supportwill be supported until end of 2031 when AXIS OS 2026 LTS reaches end of life. New products released on AXIS OS 12.0 will not have container support.

We’re confident that this streamlined SDK will enhance your development experience, making it easier than ever to build powerful, secure, and innovative applications on Axis devices.

Should you have any questions, please reach out to your Axis representative.
