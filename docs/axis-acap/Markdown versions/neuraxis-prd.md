# NEURAXIS Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## The Sentient Security Mesh for Axis Communications ACAP Platform

---

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Classification**: Confidential  
**Product Codename**: NEURAXIS  
**Target Platform**: AXIS Camera Application Platform (ACAP) 4.0+  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Product Vision
NEURAXIS transforms Axis network cameras from passive recording devices into active, intelligent security entities that understand, predict, and autonomously respond to security situations. Each camera becomes a neural node in a distributed consciousness network that eliminates false alarms, prevents incidents before they occur, and operates without human intervention.

### Success Metrics
- **False Alarm Reduction**: 94% minimum (target: 97%)
- **Prediction Accuracy**: 12-minute advance warning for security incidents
- **Deployment Time**: <60 seconds from upload to operational
- **Processing Latency**: <20ms inference time on ARTPEC-8
- **Market Penetration**: 10,000 cameras in Year 1, 1M by Year 3

### Key Differentiators
1. **Zero Configuration** - Self-configuring AI that requires no setup
2. **Predictive Intelligence** - Prevents incidents rather than detecting them
3. **Distributed Learning** - Every camera makes all cameras smarter
4. **Natural Language Interface** - No UI needed, just conversation
5. **Edge-Native Architecture** - 100% on-device processing, zero cloud dependency

---

## PRODUCT OVERVIEW

### Problem Statement
Current security systems are fundamentally broken:
- **90-99% false alarm rates** cost the industry $100B+ annually
- **Human monitoring fatigue** leads to missed real threats
- **Reactive systems** only record crimes, don't prevent them
- **Fragmented ecosystems** create operational complexity
- **Privacy concerns** limit cloud-based AI adoption
