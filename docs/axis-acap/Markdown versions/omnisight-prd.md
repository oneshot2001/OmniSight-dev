# OMNISIGHT Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## *Every Camera Becomes Omniscient*

---

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Classification**: Confidential - Disruption Imminent  
**Product Codename**: OMNISIGHT  
**Platform**: AXIS Camera Application Platform (ACAP) 4.0+  
**Tagline**: "See Everything. Understand Everything. Prevent Everything."

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Paradigm Shift
OMNISIGHT doesn't just reduce false alarms - it **prevents crime before it happens**. By combining precognitive AI, swarm intelligence, and natural language understanding, we transform every Axis camera from a passive recorder into an active guardian that sees multiple futures and helps security choose the best timeline.

### Core Innovation
**Timeline Threading™** - The industry's first precognitive security system that shows 3-5 probable futures with confidence scores, enabling intervention before incidents occur.

### Business Impact
- **Crime Prevention Rate**: 89% of incidents prevented before occurrence
- **False Alarm Reduction**: 97% (industry average: 60%)
- **Response Time**: -5 minutes (yes, negative - we respond BEFORE the incident)
- **ROI**: 400% in 90 days through prevented losses and reduced operations

### Market Opportunity
- **TAM**: $340B global security market
- **SAM**: $45B intelligent video analytics
- **SOM**: $4.5B in 5 years with 10% capture
- **Pricing Power**: 10-40x current solutions ($49-199 vs $5/camera)

## 1. PRODUCT VISION & STRATEGY

### Vision Statement
Make every camera omniscient - capable of understanding the past, observing the present, and predicting the future to create safer spaces for humanity.

### Strategic Objectives
1. **Redefine the Category**: From "video analytics" to "precognitive security"
2. **Create Platform Lock-in**: Become the iOS of physical security
3. **Network Effect Dominance**: Each camera makes all cameras exponentially smarter
4. **Insurance Integration**: Become mandatory for coverage by 2027
5. **Global Standard**: OMNISIGHT-certified buildings command premium rents

### Why Now?
- **Hardware Ready**: ARTPEC-8 DLPU can run 3B parameter models
- **Market Pain**: False alarms cost $100B+ annually
- **Technology Convergence**: Edge AI + 5G + Transformer models
- **Regulatory Push**: Liability shifting to property owners
- **Competition Absent**: Everyone still solving yesterday's problems

**Job to be Done**: Transform security from reactive to preventive  
**OMNISIGHT Value**: Shows her what WILL happen, not what DID happen  

#### 2. The Overwhelmed Operator
**Profile**: Marcus Johnson, SOC Analyst, 12-hour shifts  
**Pain**: Drowning in 1000+ daily alerts, 95% false  
**Job to be Done**: Focus only on real threats  
**OMNISIGHT Value**: Natural language queries replace complex interfaces  

#### 3. The Efficiency-Obsessed Integrator
**Profile**: TechSecure Inc., deploys 10,000 cameras/year  
**Pain**: Every install is custom, support calls endless  
**Job to be Done**: Deploy once, configure through conversation  
**OMNISIGHT Value**: 30-second setup, self-configuring AI  

#### 4. The Risk-Averse Property Manager

**Job to be Done**: Guarantee tenant and visitor safety  
**OMNISIGHT Value**: Prevention guarantee with insurance backing  

### Revolutionary Use Cases

#### The Minority Report Scenario
```
Timeline A (87% probability): Shoplifter conceals item in 43 seconds
Timeline B (72% probability): Shoplifter sees security, abandons attempt  
Action: Position security visibility → Timeline B activated → Theft prevented
```

#### The Conversation Command
```
Operator: "Watch for anyone casing the jewelry counter"
OMNISIGHT: "Understood. I'll monitor for repeated passes, extended observation, 
            or communication with accomplices. Currently tracking zero suspects."
[2 hours later]
OMNISIGHT: "Alert: Individual has passed jewelry counter 4 times in 20 minutes,
            spending 73% more time than average customers. Theft probability: 73%"
```

#### The Swarm Response
```
Camera 1: Detects suspicious individual entering
All Cameras: Instantly share threat signature
Camera 5: Recognizes same individual at loading dock
System: Correlates entrance and exit strategy
Result: Theft ring identified before first crime
```

## THE CALL TO ACTION

This PRD doesn't describe a product.
It describes a **revolution**.

We're not building better security.
We're building **precognitive protection**.

We're not reducing false alarms.
We're **preventing crime**.

We're not adding features.
We're **creating the future**.

Every day we delay, crimes happen that could be prevented.
Every day we delay, competitors get closer to this vision.
Every day we delay, we leave money and lives on the table.

**The future has already been decided.**
**Someone will build this.**
**That someone is us.**
