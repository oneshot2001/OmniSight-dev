Welcome to the AXIS Camera Application Platform (ACAP) documentation. The
ACAP SDK is an open development framework designed to empower developers to
create custom applications that run directly on Axis network devices, such
as our cameras and intercoms. By leveraging the processing capabilities of
these devices, ACAP applications enable edge-based computing with on-device,
local processing of data, reducing latency, and minimizing bandwidth usage.

When developing ACAP applications, it is important to use a supported ACAP
version. What ACAP version is supported depends on which AXIS OS LTS is
targeted. From AXIS OS 12.0 (but not before) the ACAP version aligns with
the AXIS OS version. See the figure below to find what ACAP version is
right for you. Note that the ACAP versions are clickable and take you to the
corresponding ACAP documentation version.
