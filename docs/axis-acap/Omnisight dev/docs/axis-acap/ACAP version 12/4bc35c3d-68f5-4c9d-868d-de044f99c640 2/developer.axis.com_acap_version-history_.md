# Version history

AXIS Camera Application Platform (ACAP) was introduced already in 2009 and is
the world’s first camera-based video analytics platform. Over the years, the
ACAP concept has gradually expanded allowing more types of applications,
introducing new APIs and exposing more of the device hardware for analytics.

## ACAP lifecycle management [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/version-history/\#acap-lifecycle-management "Direct link to ACAP lifecycle management")

ACAP supplies two types of lifecycle tracks: active and long-term support (LTS),
following the
[AXIS OS lifecycle](https://help.axis.com/en-us/axis-os#axis-os-lifecycle)
philosophy and naming conventions.

In the active track, we consistently add new features while also improving
cybersecurity. In LTS, we refrain from introducing new features, prioritizing to
maintain cybersecurity and fixing bugs.

### Active track [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/version-history/\#active-track "Direct link to Active track")

The most updated and feature progressive track of ACAP, that is suitable for
developers who want access to the newest features and improvements.

This track gets a new release for each minor update of AXIS OS.

### Long-term support track [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/version-history/\#long-term-support-track "Direct link to Long-term support track")

The focus of the long-term support (LTS) track is to do necessary maintenance
updates to the SDK, ACAP examples, and documentation, such as bug fixes and
cybersecurity updates. Service releases could be done to the SDK, but is rarely
necessary.

Our aim is to keep older versions in LTS for as long as there is a corresponding
AXIS OS in the LTS track.

## ACAP version 12 and higher [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/version-history/\#acap-version-12-and-higher "Direct link to ACAP version 12 and higher")

- The ACAP LTS scope is aligned to AXIS OS LTS scope of the same major.
- The ACAP version is aligned to AXIS OS version.

| Version | Release year | Lifecycle track | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 12 | 2024 | Active | This is the first release that aligns with the AXIS OS versioning.<br>See [release notes](https://developer.axis.com/acap/release-notes/) for more information |

## ACAP version 1–4 [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/version-history/\#acap-version-14 "Direct link to ACAP version 1–4")

- These ACAP versions span over multiple AXIS OS LTS releases and can be seen as a
generation where a step of major has marked a significant change, e.g. in
technology or in the offering, like a new type of SDK.
- The ACAP versions 1–4 are different from both the SDK version as well as the
AXIS OS version.

| Version | Release year | Lifecycle track | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 2021 | LTS | See the [ACAP version 4 documentation](https://developer.axis.com/acap/4/). |
| 3 | 2020 | LTS | See the [ACAP version 3 documentation](https://developer.axis.com/acap/3/). |
| 2 | 2014 | End of support: Q4 2021 | No maintenance |
| 1 | 2009 | Deprecated | No maintenance |
