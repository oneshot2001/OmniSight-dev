The pattern is as follows:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nTargetNodeName   ::= \"AudioDevice\" DeviceId Direction ConnectionId [ \".\" OptionalSuffix ] ;\nDirection        ::= \"Input\" | \"Output\" ;\nDeviceId         ::= \"0\" | NonZeroDigit { Digit } ;\nConnectionId     ::= \"0\" | NonZeroDigit { Digit } ;\nOptionalSuffix   ::= \"Unprocessed\" ;\nDigit            ::= \"0\" | NonZeroDigit ;\nNonZeroDigit     ::= \"1\" | \"2\" | \"3\" | \"4\" | \"5\" | \"6\" | \"7\" | \"8\" | \"9\" ;\n\n```\n\nIf you want to get the unprocessed audio from input 0 on device 0, the target node should be \"AudioDevice0Input0.Unprocessed\". If you want to get the processed audio, including e.g. equalizers and such, from input 1 on device 0, the target node should be \"AudioDevice0Input1\". If you want to play to output 0 of device 1, the target node should be \"AudioDevice1Output0\".\n\nTop level input nodes, e.g. AudioDevice0Input0, are removed when the corresponding input is disabled in audiodevicecontrol.cgi. This does not apply to other nodes, such as AudioDevice0Input0.Unprocessed.\n\n### Cairo [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/api/\\#cairo \"Direct link to Cairo\")\n\nOpen-source rendering library for 2D vector graphics.
