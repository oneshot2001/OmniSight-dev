For an\nACAP application to be hardware compatible with a specific device, it must be\ncompiled using the SDK corresponding to the chip architecture in the device.\n\nThe ACAP Native SDK is hardware compatible with products using the chips listed\nin the table below:\n\n| Chip | Architecture |\n| --- | --- |\n| ARTPEC-6 | armv7hf |\n| ARTPEC-7 | armv7hf |\n| ARTPEC-8 | aarch64 |\n| ARTPEC-9 | aarch64 |\n| CV25 | aarch64 |\n| i.MX 6SoloX | armv7hf |\n\nSee detailed information in the [product interface\\\\\nguide](https://www.axis.com/developer-community/product-interface-guide).\n\n## Software compatibility [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/axis-devices-and-compatibility/\\#software-compatibility \"Direct link to Software compatibility\")\n\nAn ACAP application is software compatible with AXIS OS if the APIs and other\nruntime features are available in the specific AXIS OS release. The\navailability of APIs in AXIS OS depends on both the AXIS OS version and the\ndevice itself since some APIs are only relevant for certain devices. For\nexample, the Video capture API is only available on devices with an image\nsensor\n\nChoose the appropriate SDK version based on what AXIS OS version you want\nsupporting your ACAP application.\n\nHow do I know if my device supports a specific AXIS OS version? Please check\nthe web page for download of [device software](https://www.axis.com/support/device-software).\n\ninfo\n\n**Device software** has previously been named **firmware**.\n\nThe **Image version** referred to in the table below is the Docker image\nrelease tag available from Docker Hub:\n\n- [ACAP Native SDK](https://hub.docker.com/r/axisecp/acap-native-sdk/tags)\n\nThe tag format is `<image-version>-<architecture>-<container-distribution>`.\nAn example of a tag is `axisecp/acap-native-sdk:12.0.0-aarch64-ubuntu24.04`\nwhere `12.0.0` maps to the image version.\n\n### ACAP version 12 releases [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/axis-devices-and-compatibility/\\#acap-version-12-releases \"Direct link to ACAP version 12 releases\")\n\n| ACAP Release | ACAP Native SDK Image version | Compatible with AXIS OS version |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 12.0 | 12.0.0 | 12.0 and later until LTS |\n| 12.1 | 12.1.0 | 12.1 and later until LTS |\n| 12.2 | 12.2.0 | 12.2 and later until LTS |\n| 12.3 | 12.3.0 | 12.3 and later until LTS |\n| 12.4 | 12.4.0 | 12.4 and later until LTS |\n| 12.5 | 12.5.0 | 12.5 and later until LTS |\n| 12.6 | 12.6.0 | 12.6 and later until LTS |\n\n## Forward compatibility [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/axis-devices-and-compatibility/\\#forward-compatibility \"Direct link to Forward compatibility\")\n\nAn ACAP application is forward compatible for the AXIS OS related to a specific\nSDK version. This means that the ACAP application is compatible for the listed\nAXIS OS version and future versions until the next AXIS OS LTS (Long Term\nSupport) version. After an LTS, there may be changes that break compatibility,\nfor example when a deprecated API is removed. Breaking changes are always\nannounced in advance.\n\nAn ACAP application built with an SDK that is based on an older AXIS OS version\nshould always work on a newer AXIS OS version within the same LTS window.\n\n## Feature growth between LTS releases [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/axis-devices-and-compatibility/\\#feature-growth-between-lts-releases \"Direct link to Feature growth between LTS releases\")\n\nTo get new features, always use the latest ACAP SDK release. A new feature\ncould be, for example, a new version of an API.\n\nNew SDK versions between LTS releases always add functionality in a way that an\nACAP built using a previous version will still compile with the new version\nof the SDK.\n\nRead more about AXIS OS release tracks and related information\n[here](https://help.axis.com/axis-os).\n\n## Supporting older AXIS OS [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/axis-devices-and-compatibility/\\#supporting-older-axis-os \"Direct link to Supporting older AXIS OS\")\n\nIf you want an ACAP application to be compatible with older AXIS OS, you need\nto choose an SDK for an older AXIS OS.\n\nSee the [version table](https://developer.axis.com/acap/#acap-versioning) to find the appropriate documentation depending\non the AXIS OS LTS version you want to target.\n\n## Camera loan tool [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/axis-devices-and-compatibility/\\#camera-loan-tool \"Direct link to Camera loan tool\")\n\nFind information about [virtual\\\\\nloan](https://www.axis.com/developer-community/axis-virtual-loan-tool).\n\nLast updated on **Sep 25, 2025**\n\n[Previous\\\\\n\\\\\nVersion history](https://developer.axis.com/acap/version-history/) [Next\\\\\n\\\\\nComputer vision on device](https://developer.axis.com/acap/computer-vision-on-device/)\n\n- [Hardware compatibility](https://developer.axis.com/acap/axis-devices-and-compatibility/#hardware-compatibility)\n- [Software compatibility](https://developer.axis.com/acap/axis-devices-and-compatibility/#software-compatibility)\n  - [ACAP version 12 releases](https://developer.axis.com/acap/axis-devices-and-compatibility/#acap-version-12-releases)\n- [Forward compatibility](https://developer.axis.com/acap/axis-devices-and-compatibility/#forward-compatibility)\n- [Feature growth between LTS releases](https://developer.axis.com/acap/axis-devices-and-compatibility/#feature-growth-between-lts-releases)\n- [Supporting older AXIS OS](https://developer.axis.com/acap/axis-devices-and-compatibility/#supporting-older-axis-os)\n- [Camera loan tool](https://developer.axis.com/acap/axis-devices-and-compatibility/#camera-loan-tool)\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\n- [Axis Developer Community](https://axis.com/developer-community)\n- [Axis on GitHub](https://github.com/AxisCommunications)\n\nSOCIAL\n\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/axis-communications)\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AxisCommunications)\n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE\n\n- [Legal](https://www.axis.com/legal)\n- [Privacy](https://www.axis.com/privacy)\n\n© 2025 Axis Communications AB.
