Over the years, the\nACAP concept has gradually expanded allowing more types of applications,\nintroducing new APIs and exposing more of the device hardware for analytics.\n\n## ACAP lifecycle management [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/version-history/\\#acap-lifecycle-management \"Direct link to ACAP lifecycle management\")\n\nACAP supplies two types of lifecycle tracks: active and long-term support (LTS),\nfollowing the\n[AXIS OS lifecycle](https://help.axis.com/en-us/axis-os#axis-os-lifecycle)\nphilosophy and naming conventions.\n\nIn the active track, we consistently add new features while also improving\ncybersecurity. In LTS, we refrain from introducing new features, prioritizing to\nmaintain cybersecurity and fixing bugs.\n\n### Active track [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/version-history/\\#active-track \"Direct link to Active track\")\n\nThe most updated and feature progressive track of ACAP, that is suitable for\ndevelopers who want access to the newest features and improvements.\n\nThis track gets a new release for each minor update of AXIS OS.\n\n### Long-term support track [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/version-history/\\#long-term-support-track \"Direct link to Long-term support track\")\n\nThe focus of the long-term support (LTS) track is to do necessary maintenance\nupdates to the SDK, ACAP examples, and documentation, such as bug fixes and\ncybersecurity updates. Service releases could be done to the SDK, but is rarely\nnecessary.\n\nOur aim is to keep older versions in LTS for as long as there is a corresponding\nAXIS OS in the LTS track.\n\n## ACAP version 12 and higher [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/version-history/\\#acap-version-12-and-higher \"Direct link to ACAP version 12 and higher\")\n\n- The ACAP LTS scope is aligned to AXIS OS LTS scope of the same major.\n- The ACAP version is aligned to AXIS OS version.\n\n| Version | Release year | Lifecycle track | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 12 | 2024 | Active | This is the first release that aligns with the AXIS OS versioning.<br>See [release notes](https://developer.axis.com/acap/release-notes/) for more information |\n\n## ACAP version 1–4 [​](https://developer.axis.com/acap/version-history/\\#acap-version-14 \"Direct link to ACAP version 1–4\")\n\n- These ACAP versions span over multiple AXIS OS LTS releases and can be seen as a\ngeneration where a step of major has marked a significant change, e.g. in\ntechnology or in the offering, like a new type of SDK.\n- The ACAP versions 1–4 are different from both the SDK version as well as the\nAXIS OS version.\n\n| Version | Release year | Lifecycle track | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 4 | 2021 | LTS | See the [ACAP version 4 documentation](https://developer.axis.com/acap/4/). |\n| 3 | 2020 | LTS | See the [ACAP version 3 documentation](https://developer.axis.com/acap/3/). |\n| 2 | 2014 | End of support: Q4 2021 | No maintenance |\n| 1 | 2009 | Deprecated | No maintenance |\n\nLast updated on **Sep 12, 2025**\n\n[Previous\\\\\n\\\\\nAPI compatibility guide](https://developer.axis.com/acap/api/api_compatibility_guide/) [Next\\\\\n\\\\\nAxis devices & compatibility](https://developer.axis.com/acap/axis-devices-and-compatibility/)\n\n- [ACAP lifecycle management](https://developer.axis.com/acap/version-history/#acap-lifecycle-management)\n  - [Active track](https://developer.axis.com/acap/version-history/#active-track)\n  - [Long-term support track](https://developer.axis.com/acap/version-history/#long-term-support-track)\n- [ACAP version 12 and higher](https://developer.axis.com/acap/version-history/#acap-version-12-and-higher)\n- [ACAP version 1–4](https://developer.axis.com/acap/version-history/#acap-version-14)\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\n- [Axis Developer Community](https://axis.com/developer-community)\n- [Axis on GitHub](https://github.com/AxisCommunications)\n\nSOCIAL\n\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/axis-communications)\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AxisCommunications)\n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE\n\n- [Legal](https://www.axis.com/legal)\n- [Privacy](https://www.axis.com/privacy)\n\n© 2025 Axis Communications AB.
