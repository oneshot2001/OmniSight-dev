The module is also responsible for incorporating other features such as, for example, producing object [snapshots](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/#best-snapshot-feature) and producing object [geographical coordinates](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/#geographic-coordinates).\n\nThe data processing pipeline that includes Fusion Tracker instance can be visualized as,\n\nvideo\n\nradar\n\nVideo Motion Tracker\n\nVideo Object Detection Tracker\n\nRadar Motion Tracker\n\nFusion Tracker\n\nObject Tracking Data\n\nA single Fusion Tracker module instance is dependent on data from module instances of the types:\n\n- [Video Object Detection Tracker](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/video-object-detection-tracker/)\n- [Video Motion Tracker](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/video-motion-tracker/)\n- [Radar Motion Tracker](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/radar-motion-tracker/) (if [Radar Video Fusion Feature](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/#radar-video-fusion-feature) is supported)\n\nSince this module builds on data from previous modules, the configuration of the input modules will also effect the fusion module instance.\n\n## Instances [​](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/\\#instances \"Direct link to Instances\")\n\nA device is preconfigured with a fixed number of instances of this module type.\n\nIn general there is one instance of this module type for each physical video channel corresponding to each image sensor on the device. There is an exception for multisensor cameras that producer a panorama image that is stitched from several image sensors.\n\n- Devices with one image sensor will have one tracker instance.\n- [Multidirectional cameras](https://www.axis.com/products/multidirectional-cameras) will have one tracker instance for each image sensor.\n- [Multisensor cameras](https://www.axis.com/products/multisensor-cameras) that produce a panorama image that is stitched together from several image senors will have a one instance of the tracker corresponding to the viewarea of full stitched image.\n\n## Function [​](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/\\#function \"Direct link to Function\")\n\nThe Fusion Tracker module tracks and estimates state of objects in the scene.\nThe estimated state of each tracked object is continually updated to provide up to date estimates for each object's state currently present in the scene.\n\n- Update frequency, approx 10Hz – on [multidirectional cameras](https://www.axis.com/products/multidirectional-cameras) when multiple instances are producing data the framerate may be lower.\n- Latency, approx 1s – the latency of the output varies but is generally around 1 second.\n- Heartbeat, every 2s – If no objects are detected in the scene a heartbeat message (an empty scene message) will be sent every 2s.\n\nTo indicate that an object's track has been terminated (never to be updated again) a `delete` track operation is sent. Tracked objects that are classified humans may be re-identified (ReID), this is represented by sending a `rename` track operation saying that an id has been renamed. For more information on ReID, refer to the description of ReID on the [ReID concept page](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/concepts/re-identification/).\n\n### Object state [​](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/\\#object-state \"Direct link to Object state\")\n\nDepending on how the module is configured, what sensors are considered, and other factors the exact estimated state might be different. An overview of the object state estimated for each object is found below.\n\n**General:**\n\n- `Class` \\- Object classification.\n\n  - `Human`\n  - `Human Face`\n  - `Vehicle - Car`\n  - `Vehicle -

(requires [best snapshot feature](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/#best-snapshot-feature))\n\n**2D Image Perspective:**\n\n- `Bounding Box` \\- Object position as bounding box in the image\n- `CenterOfGravity`/ `Centroid` \\- Position of the object as a point in the image\n\n**3D Device Perspective:**\n\n- `Spherical Coordinate` \\- Position of the object in spherical coordinates (requires [radar-video fusion feature](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/#radar-video-fusion-feature))\n- `Speed` \\- Speed of the object (requires [radar-video fusion feature](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/#radar-video-fusion-feature))\n- `Direction` \\- Direction of the object (requires [radar-video fusion feature](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/#radar-video-fusion-feature))\n\n**3D World Perspective:**\n\n- `Geolocation` \\- Geographic coordinates of the object (requires [geographic coordinates feature](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/#geographic-coordinates))\n\n### Track operations [​](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/\\#track-operations \"Direct link to Track operations\")\n\n- `Delete` \\- marks track end\n- `Rename` \\- renames one track id to another id\n- `Merge` \\- marks a merger to two ids into one (only on [M1135 Mk II](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-m1135-mk-ii), [M1137 Mk II](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-m1137-mk-ii) and [Q3819-PVE](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-q3819-pve))\n- `Split` \\- marks a split of one id into two (only on [M1135 Mk

No support is provided for issues at this stage.\n\n| Description | Feature flag name | Default value | Note |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Experimental classes feature | `metadata_fusion_experimental_classes` | OFF | See details [below](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/#experimental-classes). |\n\n### Best snapshot feature [​](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/\\#best-snapshot-feature \"Direct link to Best snapshot feature\")\n\nA complete list of devices that supports this feature can be found at the [AXIS Scene Metadata product page](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-scene-metadata#compatible-products) by filtering on the functionality \"Best snapshot\".\n\nThe Best Snapshot feature enables the capturing of object snapshots in a scene. When enabled this feature adds a base-64 encoded cropped image to both classified and unclassified objects.\nThe current implementation is heavily focused on bounding box size during the track lifetime.\nSnapshots may be sent more than once for each object, if better alternatives are found.\n\nThis feature interfaces with the Fusion Tracker module as shown below,\n\nvideo\n\nradar\n\nVideo Motion Tracker\n\nVideo Object Detection Tracker\n\nRadar Motion Tracker\n\nFusion Tracker\n\nBest Snapshot Generator\n\nTracking Data with Image Snapshots\n\nTo enable this feature see [guide](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/how-to-guides/best-snapshot-start/).\n\n### Radar video fusion feature [​](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/\\#radar-video-fusion-feature \"Direct link to Radar video fusion feature\")\n\ninfo\n\nThis feature is only available radar video fusion cameras such as [Q1686-DLE](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-q1686-dle) and [Q1656-DLE](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-q1656-dle).\n\nThe radar video fusion feature enables the Fusion Tracker module to also fuse tracking data generated from radar scans.\n\nThis feature will add additional information to the object state for objects detected by the radar.\nThe additional info includes\n\n- `Spherical Coordinate`\n- `Speed`\n- `Direction`\n\nAs the radar sensor is designed to detect objects far away, using this feature will also improve detection range.\n\nThis feature can also be used in combination with the [Geographic Coordinates](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/#geographic-coordinates) this feature to receive geolocation data.\n\n### License plate verifier integration feature [​](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/\\#license-plate-verifier-integration-feature \"Direct link to License plate verifier integration feature\")\n\ninfo\n\nThis feature is only available on [Q1686-DLE](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-q1686-dle).\n\nThe [AXIS License Plate Verifier ACAP](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-license-plate-verifier) enables capturing and recognizing of license plate text. By integrating this data into the Fusion Tracker module through this feature, the same information can now be provided for the Fusion Tracker module output.\n\nThe ALPV ACAP acap can be visualized as a processing module together with the Fusion Tracker module as such,\n\nvideo\n\nradar\n\nVideo Motion Tracker\n\nVideo Object Detection Tracker\n\nRadar Motion Tracker\n\nFusion Tracker\n\nALPV ACAP\n\nTracking Data with License Plate text\n\n### Geographic coordinates [​](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/\\#geographic-coordinates \"Direct link to Geographic coordinates\")\n\ninfo\n\nThis feature is only available radar video fusion cameras such as [Q1686-DLE](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-q1686-dle) and [Q1656-DLE](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-q1656-dle).\n\nThe geographic coordinates feature allows the object state in the output to include global, decimal degrees, geographical coordinates.\nFor the device to be able to calculate correct coordinates it has to be correctly and precisely configured.\nCoordinates are calculated using the lowest, middle point of each bounding-box, therefore scenarios where a human's feet are not visible will result in miscalculated coordinates.\n\nA this features is based on the data from the [Radar Motion Tracker](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/radar-motion-tracker/) module only objects being detected by the radar for a specific frame will receive geolocation data.\n\nRead the [how-to](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/how-to-guides/configure-device-geolocation/) on how to enable this feature.\n\n### Experimental classes [​](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/\\#experimental-classes \"Direct link to Experimental classes\")\n\nSome classes are considered experimental and can be turned on by the enabling the `experimental classes` feature flag, see [feature flags](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/related/feature-flags/).\n\n**Classes:**\n\n- `Bag`\n  - `Backpack`\n  - `Suitcase`\n  - `Other`\n- `Animal`\n\n**Attributes:**\n\n- `Hat` on (head/face)\n\n  - `Hard hat`\n  - `Other`\n\n## Limitations [​](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/\\#limitations \"Direct link to Limitations\")\n\n- [Mirroring](https://developer.axis.com/vapix/network-video/video-output-api/#set-mirroring) is not supported.\n\n  -
