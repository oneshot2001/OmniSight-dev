# Track consolidation

The Track Consolidation [module](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/concepts/processing-modules/) collects, summarizes and consolidates object tracks generated by the [Fusion Tracker](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/) module.

Consolidated Track Data

Since a track consolidation instance is dependent on data from a Fusion Tracker module instance, any configuration on the Fusion Tracker module can affect this module's output.
For example, features such as

- [Best Snapshot](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/#best-snapshot-feature)
- [Geographic Coordinates](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/#geographic-coordinates)

on the Fusion Tracker module instance will also effect the content of the consolidated data.

## Instances [​](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/track-consolidation/\#instances "Direct link to Instances")

A device is preconfigured with a fixed number of instances of this module type.

There is one instance of the track consolidation module for each instance of the [Fusion Tracker module](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/fusion-tracker/).

## Function [​](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/track-consolidation/\#function "Direct link to Function")

This module provides data organized as an object's track consolidation, that includes the track itself as well as some aggregate property data from the object's state.

### Properties [​](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/track-consolidation/\#properties "Direct link to Properties")

- `Classes` \- A set off all plausible classes, each score summarized
- `Vehicle Colors` \- A set off all observed colors, each score summarized
- `Human Upper Clothing Colors` \- A set off all observed colors, each score summarized
- `Human Lower Clothing Colors` \- A set off all observed colors, each score summarized
- `Observations` \- Represents the object track as a list all of all observations of the recorded of the object, including a bounding box for each observation
- `Image` \- The best image snapshot of the object
- `Min and Max speed` \- The min and max speed of the object
- `Start Time` \- Start time of the track, when the object was first detected
- `End Time` \- End time of the track, when the object was last observed
- `Duration` \- The duration of the track, i.e. elapsed time between first and last observation
- `End Reason` \- Indicates why a track ended

note

When an object detection is received, the track consolidation module saves that timestamp in UTC system time. If the system time changes during an active track, all subsequent detections then use the updated system time. As a result, the duration parameter may differ from the actual difference between the start and end times, and in some cases, depending on how large the time change is, the start time may be after the end time.

## Output protocols [​](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/track-consolidation/\#output-protocols "Direct link to Output protocols")

This module's output can be retrieved using a variety of methods. Depending on what method is used the data can be sent on different formats, below is a full list of ways to retrieve the output.

| Protocol | Name | Format | Guide |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [MQTT](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/protocols/mqtt/) | com.axis.consolidated\_track.v1.beta | [ADF Consolidated Track](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/data-formats/analytics-data-format/consolidated-track/) | [scene metadata over MQTT](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/how-to-guides/scene-metadata-over-mqtt/) |
| [Message Broker](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/protocols/message-broker/) | com.axis.consolidated\_track.v1.beta | [ADF Consolidated Track](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/data-formats/analytics-data-format/consolidated-track/) | [Build an ACAP that consumes scene metadata](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/how-to-guides/build-an-acap-that-consumes-scene-metadata/) |

## Limitations [​](https://developer.axis.com/analytics/axis-scene-metadata/reference/modules/track-consolidation/\#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")

- If 10 minutes have passed, the track is ended prematurely to conserve memory and a new track is started with a new id.
