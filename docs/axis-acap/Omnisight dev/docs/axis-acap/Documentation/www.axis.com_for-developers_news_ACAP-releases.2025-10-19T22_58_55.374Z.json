12.6](https://help.axis.com/en-us/axis-os-release-notes#axis-os-12-6). This update brings several new features and enhancements to improve your development experience and application reliability.\n\n**Key highlights:**\n\n- **New ACAP versioning diagram:** We have added a new [ACAP versioning diagram](https://developer.axis.com/acap/#acap-versioning) to help you quickly choose the right ACAP version for your project.\n- **Getting started guide:** The getting started section includes a [guide](https://developer.axis.com/acap/get-started/create-your-first-acap-application/) for creating your first ACAP application, making onboarding easier for new developers.\n- **Enhanced reliability:** We have added the _\"respawnOnFailure\"_ run mode to the application manifest schema 1.8.0. This feature automatically restarts applications that exit with errors, significantly improving reliability in production environments where high availability is critical.\n\n\n**Updated applications:**\n\n- **Improved error handling:** Some application examples have been updated with better error handling and modern practices.\n- **Power availability check:** The object detection, computer vision and video streaming examples now check power availability before loading models.\n- **Improved buffer strategies:** Enhanced buffer strategies for better performance.\n- **Memory management:** Leveraging Larod 3 functions for better memory management.\n- **Format support:** The object detection example now supports RGB format with YUV fallback and retrieves model dimensions dynamically.\n\nWe have also enhanced the [Machine Learning API documentation](https://developer.axis.com/acap/api/src/api/larod/html/md__opt_builder-doc_larod_doc_api-changes.html) with a clear overview tables of supported backend options for inference and preprocessing, making it easier to understand available capabilities and choose the right approach for your projects.\n\n**For more details,** please see the [release notes](https://developer.axis.com/acap/release-notes/12.6/). For the complete set of code examples, visit our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/AxisCommunications) where the ACAP examples are pinned at the top of the page. If you have questions or bug reports related to the examples, please report them in the issue tracker for the specific repository.\n\n## ACAP 12.5 release\n\nJune 23, 2025\n\nACAP version 12.5 is now released and compatible with [AXIS OS 12.5.](https://help.axis.com/en-us/axis-os-release-notes#axis-os-12-5)\n\nOne of the highlights of this release is the introduction of [PipeWire](https://www.pipewire.org/) support, marking the re-introduction of audio support in ACAP via a well-known API. We believe this is a great option for developers, as the existing PipeWire community is already established, and Axis is joining this community rather than creating a new one around a proprietary API. Two new examples have been created showcasing the usage of this API: one for [audio capture](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/audio-capture) and one for [audio playback.](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/audio-playback)\n\nAnother improvement is that [the bounding box example](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/bounding-box) now supports the coordinate system selection API. This enhancement allows you to more easily adapt your computer vision solutions to different coordinate systems, making your applications more robust and versatile across various use cases and device configurations.\n\nWe have also made the computer vision documentation even more developer-friendly by adding a [comprehensive table of supported operations.](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/optimization-tips/#artpec-9) This new table provides a clear overview of available functionalities, helping you quickly find the right tools and approaches for your project. Finally, we have updated the [web server example](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/web-server) to use [CivetWeb](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb) instead of Monkey. CivetWeb is a modern, lightweight, and actively maintained web server library, which should make it easier to build and maintain HTTP APIs for your ACAP applications.\n\nFor more details, please see the [release notes.](https://developer.axis.com/acap/release-notes/12.5/)\n\nFor the complete set of code examples, visit our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/AxisCommunications) where the ACAP examples are pinned at the top of the page. If you have questions or bug reports related to the examples, please report them in the issue tracker for the specific repository.\n\n## ACAP 12.4 release\n\nMay 7, 2025\n\nACAP version 12.4 is released and is compatible with [AXIS OS 12.4](https://help.axis.com/en-us/axis-os-release-notes#axis-os-12-4). The release features updates to the [axoverlay example](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/axoverlay), now supporting the corridor format, and enhanced documentation for [axis-model-zoo](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/axis-model-zoo/), providing better guidance for developers working with AI models. For stability and compatibility, developers targeting armv7hf are encouraged to rebuild their applications using SDK 12.4.\n\nFor the complete set of code examples, visit our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/AxisCommunications) where the ACAP examples are pinned at the top of the page. If you have questions or bug reports related to the examples, please report them in the issue tracker for the specific repository.\n\nThe release contains:\n\n- [ACAP Native SDK 12.4.0](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk/releases/tag/12.4.0)\n- [ACAP Runtime 2.0.0](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-runtime/tree/2.0.0) ( [Release notes](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-runtime/releases/tag/2.0.0))\n- [Docker ACAP 3.0.2](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-acap/tree/3.0.2) ( [Release notes](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-acap/releases/tag/3.0.2))\n- [Docker Compose ACAP 3.0.2](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-compose-acap/tree/3.0.2) ( [Release notes](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-compose-acap/releases/tag/3.0.2))\n\nFor more details and code examples, please see the [release notes](https://developer.axis.com/acap/release-notes/12.4/).\n\n## ACAP 12.3\n\nMarch 12, 2025\n\nACAP version 12.3 is released and is compatible with [AXIS OS 12.3](https://help.axis.com/axis-os-release-notes#axis-os-12-3). A notable enhancement in this version is the inclusion of a new [example](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/object-detection-yolov5) demonstrating the application of a YOLOv5 object detection model on an Axis camera. The example focuses on two key aspects: parsing the model's output and illustrating how to draw bounding boxes on the video stream.\n\nFor more details, please see the [release notes](https://axiscommunications.github.io/acap-documentation/docs/release-notes/12.3.html). For the complete set of code examples, visit our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/AxisCommunications) where the ACAP examples are pinned at the top of the page.

No, you didn't read that wrong, ACAP versioning is now aligned with AXIS OS!\n\nNew additions:\n\n- Version alignment: ACAP release versions and ACAP Native SDK versions now align with AXIS OS major and minor versioning. This change simplifies understanding AXIS OS compatibility.\n- Base container image: the ACAP Native SDK base container image has been updated to Ubuntu 24.04.\n\nSecurity updates:\n\n- Root-privileged access: removed in AXIS OS 12.0. For details, see the [announcement on axis.com](https://www.axis.com/developer-community/news/axis-os-root-acap-signing).\n- Application signing: signing of ACAP applications is required by default starting with AXIS OS 12.0. This can still be disabled for now but will become mandatory in a future major release.\n\nACAP Computer Vision:\n\n- Refactoring and renaming: the ACAP Computer Vision SDK is now the ACAP Computer Vision solution. Utility libraries and scripts have been moved to [ACAP Runtime](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-runtime).
