## ACAP 12.6 release

October 10, 2025

ACAP version 12.6 is now released and compatible with [AXIS OS 12.6](https://help.axis.com/en-us/axis-os-release-notes#axis-os-12-6). This update brings several new features and enhancements to improve your development experience and application reliability.

**Key highlights:**

- **New ACAP versioning diagram:** We have added a new [ACAP versioning diagram](https://developer.axis.com/acap/#acap-versioning) to help you quickly choose the right ACAP version for your project.
- **Getting started guide:** The getting started section includes a [guide](https://developer.axis.com/acap/get-started/create-your-first-acap-application/) for creating your first ACAP application, making onboarding easier for new developers.
- **Enhanced reliability:** We have added the _"respawnOnFailure"_ run mode to the application manifest schema 1.8.0. This feature automatically restarts applications that exit with errors, significantly improving reliability in production environments where high availability is critical.


**Updated applications:**

- **Improved error handling:** Some application examples have been updated with better error handling and modern practices.
- **Power availability check:** The object detection, computer vision and video streaming examples now check power availability before loading models.
- **Improved buffer strategies:** Enhanced buffer strategies for better performance.
- **Memory management:** Leveraging Larod 3 functions for better memory management.
- **Format support:** The object detection example now supports RGB format with YUV fallback and retrieves model dimensions dynamically.

We have also enhanced the [Machine Learning API documentation](https://developer.axis.com/acap/api/src/api/larod/html/md__opt_builder-doc_larod_doc_api-changes.html) with a clear overview tables of supported backend options for inference and preprocessing, making it easier to understand available capabilities and choose the right approach for your projects.

**For more details,** please see the [release notes](https://developer.axis.com/acap/release-notes/12.6/). For the complete set of code examples, visit our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/AxisCommunications) where the ACAP examples are pinned at the top of the page. If you have questions or bug reports related to the examples, please report them in the issue tracker for the specific repository.

## ACAP 12.5 release

June 23, 2025

ACAP version 12.5 is now released and compatible with [AXIS OS 12.5.](https://help.axis.com/en-us/axis-os-release-notes#axis-os-12-5)

One of the highlights of this release is the introduction of [PipeWire](https://www.pipewire.org/) support, marking the re-introduction of audio support in ACAP via a well-known API. We believe this is a great option for developers, as the existing PipeWire community is already established, and Axis is joining this community rather than creating a new one around a proprietary API. Two new examples have been created showcasing the usage of this API: one for [audio capture](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/audio-capture) and one for [audio playback.](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/audio-playback)

Another improvement is that [the bounding box example](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/bounding-box) now supports the coordinate system selection API. This enhancement allows you to more easily adapt your computer vision solutions to different coordinate systems, making your applications more robust and versatile across various use cases and device configurations.

We have also made the computer vision documentation even more developer-friendly by adding a [comprehensive table of supported operations.](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/optimization-tips/#artpec-9) This new table provides a clear overview of available functionalities, helping you quickly find the right tools and approaches for your project. Finally, we have updated the [web server example](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/web-server) to use [CivetWeb](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb) instead of Monkey. CivetWeb is a modern, lightweight, and actively maintained web server library, which should make it easier to build and maintain HTTP APIs for your ACAP applications.

For more details, please see the [release notes.](https://developer.axis.com/acap/release-notes/12.5/)

For the complete set of code examples, visit our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/AxisCommunications) where the ACAP examples are pinned at the top of the page. If you have questions or bug reports related to the examples, please report them in the issue tracker for the specific repository.

## ACAP 12.4 release

May 7, 2025

## ACAP 12.0

November 5, 2024

ACAP version 12.0 is released and is compatible with [AXIS OS 12.0](https://help.axis.com/axis-os-release-notes#axis-os-12-0). No, you didn't read that wrong, ACAP versioning is now aligned with AXIS OS!

New additions:

- Version alignment: ACAP release versions and ACAP Native SDK versions now align with AXIS OS major and minor versioning. This change simplifies understanding AXIS OS compatibility.
- Base container image: the ACAP Native SDK base container image has been updated to Ubuntu 24.04.

Security updates:

- Root-privileged access: removed in AXIS OS 12.0. For details, see the [announcement on axis.com](https://www.axis.com/developer-community/news/axis-os-root-acap-signing).
- Application signing: signing of ACAP applications is required by default starting with AXIS OS 12.0. This can still be disabled for now but will become mandatory in a future major release.

ACAP Computer Vision:

- Refactoring and renaming: the ACAP Computer Vision SDK is now the ACAP Computer Vision solution. Utility libraries and scripts have been moved to [ACAP Runtime](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-runtime). See the [acap-computer-vision-sdk-examples](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-computer-vision-sdk-examples) repository for usage.
- Deprecation notice: the ACAP Computer Vision solution is deprecated. New Axis products on AXIS OS 12.x will not have container support. Existing products with container support will be supported until the end of 2031, aligning with the end of AXIS OS 2026 LTS. The recommended approach for developing analytics, computer vision, and machine learning applications on Axis devices is using the ACAP Native SDK. See the [acap-native-sdk-examples](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples) repository for details.

For the complete set of code examples, visit our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/AxisCommunications) where the ACAP examples are pinned at the top of the page. If you have questions or bug reports related to the examples, please report them in the issue tracker for the specific repository.
