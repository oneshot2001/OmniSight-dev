## The ACAP Blueprint: "Sentinel Core"

### Core Architecture - The Minimum Viable Beast

**Primary Module: EdgeVerify Agent**
- Size: <50MB containerized ACAP
- Deployment: 5-minute auto-configuration  
- Processing: 100% on-device, zero cloud dependency
- Philosophy: Thinnest possible wedge that delivers maximum disruption

---

## Technical Architecture

### The Three-Layer Stack

#### Layer 1: Perception Engine (What's Actually Happening?)
- Lightweight YOLO-based detector optimized for ARTPEC chips
- Runs at 15fps for primary analysis, bursts to 30fps on trigger
- Tracks 5 key primitives: humans, vehicles, packages, animals, environmental
- **Secret sauce**: Temporal coherence tracking - understands *sequences* not just frames

#### Layer 2: Context Synthesizer (Should I Care?)
- Site-specific behavior baselines (learns "normal" in 72 hours)
- Time-of-day intelligence (delivery at 2am vs 2pm means different things)
- Zone-based severity mapping (parking lot vs server room)
- Weather/lighting compensation using Axis's existing image pipeline

#### Layer 3: Decision Actuator (What Do I Do?)
- Binary decision tree with confidence scoring
- Three outputs only: VERIFY (real threat), DISMISS (false positive), ESCALATE (needs human)
- Generates 15-word structured alerts: "Unauthorized person entering restricted zone, confidence 94%, moving toward server room"

## Core Capabilities

### Autonomous Threat Assessment
- AI agents analyze every alarm trigger in real-time using video context
- Sub-50ms response times with edge processing
- Continuous learning through operator feedback loops

### Intelligent Filtering
- Automatically dismiss obvious false alarms (animals, weather, lighting changes, authorized personnel)
- Reduce false alarms from 90%+ to under 10%
- Save thousands in wasted response costs

### Contextual Prioritization
- Rank genuine threats by severity, location, and behavior patterns
- Multi-sensor correlation from cameras, motion sensors, access control
- Site-specific training and adaptation

---

## Integration Strategy - The Trojan Horse

### Phase 1: Parasitic Enhancement
- MQTT broker for instant VMS integration
- Webhooks for everything (Slack, Teams, SMS)
- ONVIF metadata injection (appear as enhanced motion detection)
- REST API that speaks everyone's language

### Phase 2: Network Effect
- Cameras share threat signatures across sites
- Distributed learning without video sharing (privacy-compliant)
- "Swarm intelligence" - multiple cameras collaborate on single events

### Vendor-Agnostic Support
- ONVIF Profile S compliance
- RTSP universal compatibility
- Major VMS platforms through universal API
- No vendor lock-in

## The Simplification Manifesto

### What We're NOT Building
- ❌ Complex UI (settings fit on one screen)
- ❌ Cloud dependency (works in bunker mode)
- ❌ Video storage (we're verification, not VMS)
- ❌ Custom protocols (standard everything)
- ❌ Feature creep (do one thing perfectly)

### What We ARE Building
- ✅ Invisible enhancement layer
- ✅ Immediate value delivery (24 hours to ROI)
- ✅ Intelligent learning system
- ✅ Independent operation
- ✅ Inevitable market solution

## Call to Action

This isn't just an ACAP app. It's the thin edge of the wedge that transforms dumb sensors into an autonomous security mesh. Every camera becomes a data point. Every site becomes smarter. Every false alarm dismissed is a moat-widening event.

Once customers taste real AI-powered verification, they'll never go back to drowning in false alarms.

**Ready to build the future the Axis founders would've built if they started today?**

**Let's make those cameras think.**
