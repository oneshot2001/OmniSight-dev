# Video streaming & recording

Axis has been a key player in the field of video streaming and recording solutions for many years. Our robust video technology has evolved over time, continually adapting to meet the ever-changing needs of the industry.

Our current offerings provide developers with the tools they need to capture, store, and stream video effectively. Our solutions are designed with scalability in mind, accommodating a wide range of use cases, from small-scale applications to enterprise-level systems. As a developer working with Axis products, you can leverage our extensive experience and cutting-edge technology to create reliable and efficient video streaming and recording applications.

A significant part of our API (Application Programming Interface) offering is [VAPIX](https://developer.axis.com/vapix/). VAPIX provides developers with the tools needed to build applications that can capture, store, and stream video effectively.

Axis also played a pivotal role in establishing [ONVIF](https://www.onvif.org/), a forum that provides and promotes standardized interfaces for effective interoperability of IP-based physical security products.
