Our robust video technology has evolved over time, continually adapting to meet the ever-changing needs of the industry.\n\nOur current offerings provide developers with the tools they need to capture, store, and stream video effectively. Our solutions are designed with scalability in mind, accommodating a wide range of use cases, from small-scale applications to enterprise-level systems. As a developer working with Axis products, you can leverage our extensive experience and cutting-edge technology to create reliable and efficient video streaming and recording applications.\n\nA significant part of our API (Application Programming Interface) offering is [VAPIX](https://developer.axis.com/vapix/). VAPIX provides developers with the tools needed to build applications that can capture, store, and stream video effectively.\n\nAxis also played a pivotal role in establishing [ONVIF](https://www.onvif.org/), a forum that provides and promotes standardized interfaces for effective interoperability of IP-based physical security products.\n\nLast updated on **Aug 18, 2025**\n\n[Next\\\\\n\\\\\nZipstream](https://developer.axis.com/video-streaming-and-recording/zipstream/)\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\n- [Axis Developer Community](https://axis.com/developer-community)\n- [Axis on GitHub](https://github.com/AxisCommunications)\n\nSOCIAL\n\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/axis-communications)\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AxisCommunications)\n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE\n\n- [Legal](https://www.axis.com/legal)\n- [Privacy](https://www.axis.com/privacy)\n\nÂ© 2025 Axis Communications AB.
