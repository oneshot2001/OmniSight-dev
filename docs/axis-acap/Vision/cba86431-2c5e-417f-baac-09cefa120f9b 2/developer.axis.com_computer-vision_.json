By training and deploying your own **deep learning models**, you can perform real-time video analysis directly on the camera, reducing reliance on cloud-based processing and improving system efficiency.\n\n## Leverage the DLPU for Edge AI [​](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/\\#leverage-the-dlpu-for-edge-ai \"Direct link to Leverage the DLPU for Edge AI\")\n\nThe **DLPU** in Axis cameras is designed to execute deep learning models optimized for **real-time object detection, classification, and tracking**. This enables applications such as:\n\n- **Object and people detection** – Identify specific objects, people, or vehicles directly on the camera.\n- **Behavior analysis and anomaly detection** – Recognize unusual activities and trigger events.\n- **Traffic and retail analytics** – Track movement patterns for insights and automation.\n\n## Benefits of running deep learning on Axis cameras [​](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/\\#benefits-of-running-deep-learning-on-axis-cameras \"Direct link to Benefits of running deep learning on Axis cameras\")\n\n- **Efficient Edge Processing** – No need for external servers, reducing costs and infrastructure complexity.\n- **Low Latency** – Real-time inference directly on the camera enables faster decision-making.\n- **Reduced Bandwidth Consumption** – Transmit only relevant metadata instead of raw video streams.\n- **Scalability** – Deploy applications across multiple cameras in a network.\n- **Security and Privacy** – Keep sensitive data on-premise, minimizing exposure to external networks.\n\nBy **running inference directly on the camera**, you achieve lower **latency, reduced bandwidth usage, and enhanced data privacy**—critical for **security, industrial automation, and smart city applications**.\n\nLast updated on **Aug 18, 2025**\n\n[Next\\\\\n\\\\\nDevelop your own deep learning application](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/develop-your-own-deep-learning-application/)\n\n- [Leverage the DLPU for Edge AI](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/#leverage-the-dlpu-for-edge-ai)\n- [Benefits of running deep learning on Axis cameras](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/#benefits-of-running-deep-learning-on-axis-cameras)\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\n- [Axis Developer Community](https://axis.com/developer-community)\n- [Axis on GitHub](https://github.com/AxisCommunications)\n\nSOCIAL\n\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/axis-communications)\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AxisCommunications)\n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE\n\n- [Legal](https://www.axis.com/legal)\n- [Privacy](https://www.axis.com/privacy)\n\n© 2025 Axis Communications AB.
