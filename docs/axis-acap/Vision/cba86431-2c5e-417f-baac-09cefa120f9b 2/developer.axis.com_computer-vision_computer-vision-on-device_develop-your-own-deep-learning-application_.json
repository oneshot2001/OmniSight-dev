ACAP provides access to camera resources, including the **image pipeline, processing power, and network interfaces**, enabling seamless integration of **deep learning models** with on-device AI processing.\n\n## Workflow to deploy a deep learning model [​](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/develop-your-own-deep-learning-application/\\#workflow-to-deploy-a-deep-learning-model \"Direct link to Workflow to deploy a deep learning model\")\n\n### 1\\. Train a model [​](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/develop-your-own-deep-learning-application/\\#1-train-a-model \"Direct link to 1. Train a model\")\n\n- Use the standard deep learning framework **TensorFlow** to train your model.\n- Choose a model architecture that is optimized for **Axis DLPU**. Refer to:\n\n  - [Recommended Model Architectures](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/recommended-model-architecture/)\n  - [Axis Model Zoo](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/axis-model-zoo) for pre-trained models and training scripts.\n\n### 2\\. Convert the model for deployment [​](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/develop-your-own-deep-learning-application/\\#2-convert-the-model-for-deployment \"Direct link to 2. Convert the model for deployment\")\n\n- Axis cameras of different system-on-chip (SoC) have different **DLPU**. Ensure compatibility by following the guidelines for model conversion:\n\n  - [DLPU Model Conversion Guide](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/dlpu-model-conversion/)\n- Optimize the model by using techniques such as **quantization and pruning** to ensure efficient execution on the camera.\n\n### 3\\. Integrate the model with an ACAP application [​](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/develop-your-own-deep-learning-application/\\#3-integrate-the-model-with-an-acap-application \"Direct link to 3. Integrate the model with an ACAP application\")\n\n- Develop a **custom ACAP application** to manage video input, run inference, and handle outputs.\n- Use ACAP APIs to access **image data, event handling, and network communication**.\n- See [ACAP SDK Examples](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples) for sample implementations of ACAP applications.\n\n### 4\\. Deploy and run on the camera [​](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/develop-your-own-deep-learning-application/\\#4-deploy-and-run-on-the-camera \"Direct link to 4. Deploy and run on the camera\")\n\n- Package the application and deploy it directly onto the Axis camera.\n- Run real-time inference with minimal latency, enabling **immediate event triggers, metadata generation, or integration with external systems**.\n\n## Get started with ACAP and deep learning [​](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/develop-your-own-deep-learning-application/\\#get-started-with-acap-and-deep-learning \"Direct link to Get started with ACAP and deep learning\")\n\nTo get started, you can explore the examples of deep learning applications available in our GitHub repositories. The [ACAP SDK Examples](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples) repository contains examples to run deep learning applications directly on the Axis device.\n\nExamples such as [vdo-larod](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/vdo-larod) and [object-detection](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/object-detection) demonstrate the usage of our Machine Learning API also called Larod. Larod is a C API that enables you to run deep learning models in the TensorFlow Lite format.\n\nBefore diving into the development of your application, we recommend that you continue reading the rest of this documentation to understand the advantages and limitations of deploying a deep learning model on an Axis device.\n\nLast updated on **Mar 25, 2025**\n\n[Previous\\\\\n\\\\\nComputer vision](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/) [Next\\\\\n\\\\\nAxis Deep Learning Processing Unit (DLPU)](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/axis-dlpu/)\n\n- [Workflow to deploy a deep learning model](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/develop-your-own-deep-learning-application/#workflow-to-deploy-a-deep-learning-model)\n  - [1\\.
