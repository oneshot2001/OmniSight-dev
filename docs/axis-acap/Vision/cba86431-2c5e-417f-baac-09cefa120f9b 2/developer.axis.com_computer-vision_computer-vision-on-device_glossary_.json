Different task can use the same network architecture as backbone (e.g. classification and object detection).\n- Head - In the context of a Neural Network, the head is the part of the model that is responsible for the specific task. For example, in an object detection model, the head is responsible for predicting the bounding boxes and the class of the objects in the image.\n- Larod - It is the name of the Axis Machine Learning API. It is used to run deep learning models in the TensorFlow Lite format.\n\nLast updated on **Aug 18, 2025**\n\n[Previous\\\\\n\\\\\nTest your model](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/test-your-model/) [Next\\\\\n\\\\\nSend images to AWS S3](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/how-to-guides/send-images-to-aws-s3/)\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\n- [Axis Developer Community](https://axis.com/developer-community)\n- [Axis on GitHub](https://github.com/AxisCommunications)\n\nSOCIAL\n\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/axis-communications)\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AxisCommunications)\n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE\n\n- [Legal](https://www.axis.com/legal)\n- [Privacy](https://www.axis.com/privacy)\n\nÂ© 2025 Axis Communications AB.
