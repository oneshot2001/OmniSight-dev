CV25 uses a proprietary format, but it can be converted from TensorFlow Lite or ONNX. When using the tflite model, keep in mind that only tflite built-in int8 ops are supported to run on the DLPU `tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS_INT8`. Custom ops or TensorFlow ops are not supported.\nThe exact version of TensorFlow on the device can change depending on the device model and firmware. You can find the exact TensorFlow version in the\nSoftware Bill of Materials associated to the firmware of your specific device in the [Download device software](https://www.axis.com/support/device-software) page.\n\n## Converting from TensorFlow or Keras to TensorFlow Lite [​](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/supported-frameworks/\\#converting-from-tensorflow-or-keras-to-tensorflow-lite \"Direct link to Converting from TensorFlow or Keras to TensorFlow Lite\")\n\nTo convert a TensorFlow/Keras model to a tflite model, you can use the tflite converter. This is the most reliable way to convert a model to tflite. Here is an example code snippet on how to convert a model to tflite:\n\nConvert to tflite\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nconverter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model(saved_model_dir)\nconverter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]\nconverter.representative_dataset = a_representative_datagenerator\nconverter.target_spec.supported_ops = [tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS_INT8]\nconverter.inference_input_type = tf.uint8\nconverter.inference_output_type = tf.uint8\ntflite_quant_model = converter.convert()\n\n```\n\nYou can find the full code example [here](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/blob/main/tensorflow-to-larod/env/convert_model.py).\n\nIn the case of ARTPEC-8, if the script is based on TensorFlow 2, the following flag is also needed to achieve optimal performance.\n\nConvert to tflite\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nconverter._experimental_disable_per_channel = True\n\n```\n\n## Converting from ONNX to TensorFlow Lite [​](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/supported-frameworks/\\#converting-from-onnx-to-tensorflow-lite \"Direct link to Converting from ONNX to TensorFlow Lite\")\n\nNo Axis DLPUs, except for CV25, support ONNX models. However, you can try converting an ONNX model to a tflite model using the unofficial [onnx2tflite](https://github.com/MPolaris/onnx2tflite) or [onnx2tf](https://github.com/PINTO0309/onnx2tf) tools. Please note that these tools are not supported by Axis, and there is no guarantee that the conversion will work or that the converted model will run on the device. Debugging may be required to make the model run on the device.\n\n## Converting from PyTorch to TensorFlow Lite [​](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/supported-frameworks/\\#converting-from-pytorch-to-tensorflow-lite \"Direct link to Converting from PyTorch to TensorFlow Lite\")\n\nAxis DLPUs do not support PyTorch models. However, you can export a PyTorch model to ONNX and then convert it to tflite. You can find an example [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/super_resolution_with_onnxruntime.html). Please note that jumping from PyTorch to ONNX to TFlite is not recommended and may require a lot of trial and error.\n\n## Using Non-Supported Frameworks [​](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/supported-frameworks/\\#using-non-supported-frameworks \"Direct link to Using Non-Supported Frameworks\")\n\nAlthough PyTorch and ONNX are not supported, it is theoretically possible to run a Python script that uses PyTorch or ONNX runtime to run the model in a Docker container on the device. Please note that this is not supported by Axis, and there is no guarantee that it will work smoothly. Keep in mind that the model will only run on the CPU and will not take advantage of the DLPU to accelerate the inference.\n\nLast updated on **Aug 18, 2025**\n\n[Previous\\\\\n\\\\\nAxis Deep Learning Processing Unit (DLPU)](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/axis-dlpu/) [Next\\\\\n\\\\\nQuantization](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/quantization/)\n\n- [Converting from TensorFlow or Keras to TensorFlow Lite](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/supported-frameworks/#converting-from-tensorflow-or-keras-to-tensorflow-lite)\n- [Converting from ONNX to TensorFlow Lite](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/supported-frameworks/#converting-from-onnx-to-tensorflow-lite)\n- [Converting from PyTorch to TensorFlow Lite](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/supported-frameworks/#converting-from-pytorch-to-tensorflow-lite)\n- [Using Non-Supported Frameworks](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/computer-vision-on-device/supported-frameworks/#using-non-supported-frameworks)\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\n- [Axis Developer Community](https://axis.com/developer-community)\n- [Axis on GitHub](https://github.com/AxisCommunications)\n\nSOCIAL\n\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/axis-communications)\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AxisCommunications)\n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE\n\n- [Legal](https://www.axis.com/legal)\n- [Privacy](https://www.axis.com/privacy)\n\n© 2025 Axis Communications AB.
