# Computer vision

Axis cameras equipped with a **Deep Learning Processing Unit (DLPU)** provide a powerful platform for running **custom computer vision applications** at the edge. By training and deploying your own **deep learning models**, you can perform real-time video analysis directly on the camera, reducing reliance on cloud-based processing and improving system efficiency.

## Leverage the DLPU for Edge AI [​](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/\#leverage-the-dlpu-for-edge-ai "Direct link to Leverage the DLPU for Edge AI")

The **DLPU** in Axis cameras is designed to execute deep learning models optimized for **real-time object detection, classification, and tracking**. This enables applications such as:

- **Object and people detection** – Identify specific objects, people, or vehicles directly on the camera.
- **Behavior analysis and anomaly detection** – Recognize unusual activities and trigger events.
- **Traffic and retail analytics** – Track movement patterns for insights and automation.

## Benefits of running deep learning on Axis cameras [​](https://developer.axis.com/computer-vision/\#benefits-of-running-deep-learning-on-axis-cameras "Direct link to Benefits of running deep learning on Axis cameras")

- **Efficient Edge Processing** – No need for external servers, reducing costs and infrastructure complexity.
- **Low Latency** – Real-time inference directly on the camera enables faster decision-making.
- **Reduced Bandwidth Consumption** – Transmit only relevant metadata instead of raw video streams.
- **Scalability** – Deploy applications across multiple cameras in a network.
- **Security and Privacy** – Keep sensitive data on-premise, minimizing exposure to external networks.

By **running inference directly on the camera**, you achieve lower **latency, reduced bandwidth usage, and enhanced data privacy**—critical for **security, industrial automation, and smart city applications**.
